# Intro to Energibridge

This repository is an introduction to the energy measurement tool EnergiBridge, used in the Sustainable Software Engineering course at TU Delft. The repository contains a notebook with info about the EnergiBridge output fields, depending on CPU vendor. It also contains a simple example to do energy measurements and how to read and process the generated CSVs.

- `basic-analysis.ipynb`: Field info and CSV reading examples
- `data`: CSV files for the 2 examples
- `mandelbrot`: Rust code to compute a Mandelbrot set, can be used to try out EnergiBridge or other energy measurement tool
